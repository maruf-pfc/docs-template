# Introduction to React

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It enables developers to create reusable UI components and manage state efficiently.

## Features

- **Component-Based**: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state.
- **Declarative UI**: Describe how your UI should look, and React updates it efficiently.
- **Virtual DOM**: Optimizes rendering performance.

## Getting Started

To create a new React project using Vite:

```sh
pnpm create vite my-app --template react
cd my-app
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
