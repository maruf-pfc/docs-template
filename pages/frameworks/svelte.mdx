# Introduction to Svelte

Svelte is a JavaScript framework that shifts the work from the browser to the build step, resulting in highly optimized and performant applications.

## Features

- **No Virtual DOM**: Compiles components into highly efficient vanilla JavaScript.
- **Truly Reactive**: State updates trigger immediate DOM updates.
- **Lightweight**: Produces smaller, faster bundles.

## Getting Started

To create a new Svelte project:

```sh
pnpm create vite my-app --template svelte
cd my-app
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
