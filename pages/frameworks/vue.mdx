# Introduction to Vue.js

Vue.js is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. It is designed to be incrementally adaptable, making it easy to integrate with existing projects.

## Features

- **Reactive Data Binding**: Efficiently updates the DOM when data changes.
- **Component System**: Reusable and composable components.
- **Directives**: Provides built-in directives like `v-if`, `v-for`, and `v-model`.

## Getting Started

To create a new Vue project using Vite:

```sh
pnpm create vite my-app --template vue
cd my-app
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
